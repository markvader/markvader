## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mark B, Recently finished a PgCert in Professional Software Development with Data Science. Really enjoying Java and learning to like python and data science.

I have a strong interest in Diabetes Technology and am a contributor to various opensource projects in the DIY Artifical Pancreas world.  Closed loop systems are the (near) future for Diabetes and its here for the bold and the brave now.

Recent work includes a winning submission at a local hackathon, you can view it on [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13wBNNhfVFs7CJv8-uCagxPHKleA9qxhC?usp=sharing).

Much more to come.

Mark
