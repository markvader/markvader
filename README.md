## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mark B, I am currently retraining in Data Engineering & Data Science having worked in a non-IT related field for 15 years. I really like to dabble in many areas with software and contribute to a variety of projects in hardware (C++), Home Automation (mainly Python) & Medical Software (Java & User Documentation).

I have a strong interest in diabetes technology (having had type 1 Diabetes for over 22 years) and try to contribute to various opensource projects in the DIY Artifical Pancreas world and support the users of these systems.  Commercial closed loop systems are the (near) future for Diabetes and DIY systems are here for the bold and the brave now. I use [AndroidAPS](https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS), [xDrip+](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip) & [Nightscout](https://github.com/markvader/cgm-remote-monitor)

Being a big fan of Home Assistant [Website](https://www.home-assistant.io/)/[Github](https://github.com/home-assistant), the open source home automation project (that puts local control and privacy first), I've taken on maintaining and developing some integrations.  I maintain and develop the [ha-rpi_rf](https://github.com/markvader/ha-rpi_rf) custom component, I've written a [python library](https://github.com/markvader/herolabsapi) for the [Sonic water smart shutoff valve by Hero Labs](https://www.hero-labs.com/) and a [Home Assistant integration](https://github.com/markvader/sonic) for this device.  I've now turned my attention to the local api, to really gave users local control and not have to be dependent on a webservice.

Want to collobrate, let me know

Much more to come.

Mark
