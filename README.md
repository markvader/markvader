## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mark B, Recently finished a PgCert in Professional Software Development with Data Science. Dabbling in a mixture of things to build my skills. Java, Python and currently C++.

I have a strong interest in diabetes technology and try to contribute to various opensource projects in the DIY Artifical Pancreas world.  Closed loop systems are the (near) future for Diabetes and its here for the bold and the brave now. I use https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS


Much more to come.

Mark
