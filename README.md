## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mark B, Recently finished a PgCert in Professional Software Development with Data Science. Dabbling in a mixture of languages and projects to build my skills. Java, Python, C++ etc.

I have a strong interest in diabetes technology (having had type 1 Diabetes for over 21 years) and try to contribute to various opensource projects in the DIY Artifical Pancreas world and support the users of these systems.  Closed loop systems are the (near) future for Diabetes and DIY systems are here for the bold and the brave now. I use [AndroidAPS](https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS), [xDrip+](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip) & [Nightscout](https://github.com/markvader/cgm-remote-monitor)


Much more to come.

Mark
