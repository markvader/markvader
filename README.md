## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mark B, Recently finished a PgCert in Professional Software Development with Data Science. Dabbling in a mixture of things to build my skills. Java, Python and currently C++.

I have a strong interest in diabetes technology (having type 1 Diabetes for 21 years) and try to contribute to various opensource projects in the DIY Artifical Pancreas world and support the users of these systems.  Closed loop systems are the (near) future for Diabetes and its here for the bold and the brave now. I use https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS, https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip & https://github.com/markvader/cgm-remote-monitor


Much more to come.

Mark
